Reflection - This was a very needed project to shake the rust off. I feel as if I not only remembered a lot from last year but learned a lot as well. I ran into big issues with media queries and other small things however the biggest problem I ran into would be github itself. I was testing the page on two different sized monitors and both live servers and through the github deployment and all four of them were different even after waiting an hour for everything to catch up. I did coded in all my spare time I had this week and finished right before the deadline so hopefully it all works in the end but the biggest lesson learned was several issues with media queries and speeding up the process of coding a web page so I have more time to test it before turning it in
